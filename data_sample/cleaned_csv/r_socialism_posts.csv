1n5acl3,socialism,1756685821,Mass Shootings Are What Happens When a Nation Is Built on Violence/capitalism,"Mass shootings aren't about hormones
""mental health"" or just guns. That's the distraction both liberals and conservatives sell.

They're rooted in the intersection of colonialism, capitalism, imperialism, racism, white supremacy, and patriarchal Christian nationalism.

You can break them down into three main types: Gang related,
interpersonal/revenge & Political/ ideological

Every one of these ties back to systems of oppression and material conditions.

It's not an ""individual sickness"" it's the violence of a society built on alienation, deprivation, and exploitation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1n5acl3/mass_shootings_are_what_happens_when_a_nation_is/,self.socialism,True,64,5,0.9800000190734864,WittyEgg2037,False,False,/r/socialism/comments/1n5acl3/mass_shootings_are_what_happens_when_a_nation_is/
1n5aexd,socialism,1756686013,DSA endorses gerrymandering in California,"Notable socialists who oppose this include Nina Turner and Butch Ware, saying gerrymandering has historically disenfranchised voters.

DSA says it's necessary to halt immediate GOP advances of fascism.

I would imagine an ungerrymandered urban district would be more  leftist and likely to elect a disruptive socialist, while gerrymandered districts are watered down and more suspectable to close elections, where liberals weaponize ""vote blue no matter who"" to suppress leftist movement.

1n5bp41,socialism,1756689875,"What is the link between the online far-right and anime women, particularly ""loli"" characters?","I notice that a lot of online neo-nazis tend to big anime fans, especially loli. What makes it so appealing to them? Is it simply pedophilia? Is it the fact that anime tends to present an idealized form of femininity to these men to consume? One that is perfectly curated for the male gaze? Is it because it is the only way for them to express their own femininity within the rigid confines of patriarchal masculinity that they see as sacred? Not all neo-nazis online are loli fans, but many are. Why?

Personally, I think it's a playground fantasy for these men. Anime women, especially lolis, tend to be presented as submissive, cute, powerless, obedient, dependent on a male figure and forever childlike. This lines up with the rigid gender roles they subscribe to; men are dominant and protectors and women are infantile and need male guidance. I also think these men cling to anime women since many are social outcasts where real interaction and romance with women is nonexistent. So they burrow and retreat into this safe form of femininity and female interaction, one that perfectly coddles them. In a perhaps more odd sense, I also think this retreat is a effect of their own alienation. Alienated in their own personal lives, the infantilization and powerlessness of these characters can mirror their own personal turmoil. It's an odd way to express their own disempowerment.
