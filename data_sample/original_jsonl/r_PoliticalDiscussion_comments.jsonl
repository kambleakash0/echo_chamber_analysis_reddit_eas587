There two basic realities here liberals refuse to accept:\n\n1. The Palestinians are fucking awful international actors and commuting more war crimes than Israel.

The money the U.S. gives to Israel in military surplus is less than 10% of their military budget and less than 0.5% of their GDP, and itâ€™s mostly on high precision stuff. If the U.S. turned their back on Israel, Russia and China would gleefully work with Israel with their advanced military and cybersecurity expertise. That would strategically bad for the U.S., and bad for the Palestinians. Because if anyone could care less about how to deal with a radical terror state, is Russia and China.
