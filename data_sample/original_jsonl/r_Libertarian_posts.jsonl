WARNING I AM NOT FROM THE UNITED STATES IF I GET ANYTHING WRONG PLEASE CALL ME OUT. ADDITIONALLY I AM A NEW LIBITARIAN AND I AM STILL LEARNING PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I GET ANYTHING WRONG.  \n\n\nARGUMENT ONE: \"Tax evasion is only illegal when you commit fraud, which means that libertarians are basically arguing that fraud should be legal.\"\n\n...No... because if taxes did not exist then tax fraud would not exist... therefore in a society where taxation didn't exist it would be impossible to commit tax fraud...\n\nARGUMENT TWO: \"Libertarians consent to paying income taxes when they sign a W-4 form agreeing to withholdings as a condition for getting the job. If you refuse to sign a W-4 form when applying for a job, you likely won't get hired, but no one from the IRS will put a gun to your head and force you to sign the form against your will. The only time people go to jail is when they commit fraud, i.e., if you sign a form agreeing to pay taxes, but then you lie about your earnings or expenses.\"\n\nWoah playing a little fast and loose with the definition of consent arnt we? Ok first what is a W-4 form? According to the oh so reliable Wikipedia a W-4 form is: \"Form W-4 is a tax form completed by an employee in the United States to indicate his or her tax situation to the employer. The W-4 form tells the employer the correct amount of federal tax to withhold from an employee's pay check.\"\n\nOk now with that out of the way its pretty easy to debunk this argument as to why signing this form is not a valid form of consent and I don't even have to make any arguments because the argument debunks itself. A W-4 form is a form which is forced onto the population without its consent that makes it deliberately harder to get a Job as OOP rightfully points out. For consent to be valid it must be freely given without any coercion, pressure, or undue influence. When you get a W-4 form it is essential the state telling you \"Sign this or we will make your life very hard for you\" That is not consent it is coercion. therefore If I sign a 4-W form I am not giving a valid form of consent. Additionally this argument literally only works in the united states. In my country Australia if you don't provide the tax office your tax file number, your employer or any business that pays you must withhold tax on your behalf at the highest income tax bracket. \n\nARGUMENT THREE: \"Libertarians often whine they still owe taxes even if they move overseas, but how would the IRS have any jurisdiction, especially with the presumption of innocence? Generally, the only way for that to happen is if they voluntarily move money through the US banking system. i.e., Bitcoin is generally untraceable right up until you try to exchange it for actual money. But again, no one is putting a gun to their head and forcing them to do that against their will. They choose to participate with the US banking system for the security and convenience, but this also carries the condition that suspicion of tax fraud can be reported to the IRS.\"\n\nOk once again this agreeing to use the US banking system is not a valid form of consent. living entirely outside the US banking system is very challenging. Even if you do manage to entirely live completely outside of the system then certain necessities like taxes may still require engagement. The state deliberately makes it harder for you to live outside of the system to force you into the US banking system  so that they can tax you. Its not a valid form of consent because 90 percent of the population simply cannot afford to live outside the system. \n\nARGUMENT FOUR: \"Libertarians consent to paying taxes by participating in the economy If you don't pay taxes, then you're going to have a much harder time dealing with landlords, finding insurance, etc.\"\n\nI've pretty much already covered this the state will make your life hell if you don't play by there rules and therefore not a valid form of consent I'm beginning to sound like a broken record. \n\nARGUMENT FOUR: \"a ride share driver agreeing to give 90% of his earnings is consensual  because he signed a contract, despite the fact doesn't like the terms. But the same driver agreeing to pay 10% of his earnings for taxes is non consensual because he doesn't like the terms,  despite the fact he signed a contract. This is a double standard\"\n\nExcept if I don't want to work for uber corporation I can just say no thanks and we shake hands and go both go our separate ways. The state will deliberately make your life harder if you don't agree to pay your taxes in some way shape or form.\n\nAny way they list off a few more but I'm not interested in covering them at the moment thanks for reading please point out anything I got wrong once again I'm not American and I am a fairly new libertarian.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Libertarian","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh63","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Libertarian","subreddit_subscribers":501874,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Found some arguments which claim we consent to taxes so lets debunk them together.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"ups":13,"upvote_ratio":0.6800000071525574,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1n5lue0/found_some_arguments_which_claim_we_consent_to/","user_reports":[],"view_count":null,"visited":false,"wls":7}
